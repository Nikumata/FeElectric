FeElectric,WOS:000348600200017,15-Feb,2015,Giant switchable photovoltaic effect in organometal trihalide perovskite devices,"Organolead trihalide perovskite (OTP) materials are emerging as naturally abundant materials for low-cost, solution-processed and highly effcient solar cells(1-9). Here, we show that, in OTP-based photovoltaic devices with vertical and lateral cell configurations, the photocurrent direction can be switched repeatedly by applying a small electric field of < 1V mu m(-1). The switchable photocurrent, generally observed in devices based on ferroelectric materials, reached 20.1 mAcm(-2) under one sun illumination in OTP devices with a vertical architecture, which is four orders of magnitude larger than lthat measured in other ferroelectric photovoltaic devices(10,11). This field-switchable photovoltaic effect can be explained by the formation of reversible p-i-n structures induced by ion drift in the perovskite layer. The demonstration of switchable OTP photovoltaics and electric-field-manipulated doping paves the way for innovative solar cell designs and for the exploitation of OTP materials in electrically and optically readable memristors and circuits."
FeElectric,WOS:000362041300009,2015,2015,Inorganic caesium lead iodide perovskite solar cells,"The vast majority of perovskite solar cell research has focused on organic-inorganic lead trihalide perovskites. Herein, we present working inorganic CsPbI3 perovskite solar cells for the first time. CsPbI3 normally resides in a yellow non-perovskite phase at room temperature, but by careful processing control and development of a low-temperature phase transition route we have stabilised the material in the black perovskite phase at room temperature. As such, we have fabricated solar cell devices in a variety of architectures, with current-voltage curve measured efficiency up to 2.9% for a planar heterojunction architecture, and stabilised power conversion efficiency of 1.7%. The well-functioning planar junction devices demonstrate long-range electron and hole transport in this material. Importantly, this work identifies that the organic cation is not essential, but simply a convenience for forming lead triiodide perovskites with good photovoltaic properties. We additionally observe significant rate-dependent current-voltage hysteresis in CsPbI3 devices, despite the absence of the organic polar molecule previously thought to be a candidate for inducing hysteresis via ferroelectric polarisation. Due to its space group, CsPbI3 cannot be a ferroelectric material, and thus we can conclude that ferroelectricity is not required to explain current-voltage hysteresis in perovskite solar cells. Our report of working inorganic perovskite solar cells paves the way for further developments likely to lead to much more thermally stable perovskite solar cells and other optoelectronic devices."
FeElectric,WOS:000350191900001,15-Jun,2015,Transferring lead-free piezoelectric ceramics into application,"After twenty years of partly quiet and ten years of partly enthusiastic research into lead-free piezoceramics there are now clear prospects for transfer into applications in some areas. This mimics prior research into eliminating lead from other technologies that resulted in restricted lead use in batteries and dwindling use in other applications. A figure of merit analysis for key devices is presented and used to contrast lead-containing and lead-free piezoceramics. A number of existing applications emerge, where the usage of lead-free piezoceramics may be envisaged in the near future. A sufficient transition period to ensure reliability, however, is required. The use of lead-free piezoceramics for demanding applications with high reliability, displacements and frequency as well as a wide temperature range appears to remain in the distant future. New devices are outlined, where the figure of merit suggests skipping lead-containing piezoceramics altogether. Suggestions for the next pertinent research requirements are provided.

FeElectric,WOS:000348031800008,JAN 21 2015,2015,Core-Shell Structured High-k Polymer Nanocomposites for Energy Storage and Dielectric Applications,"High-k polymer nanocomposites have considerable potential in energy storage and dielectric applications because of their ease of processing, flexibility, and low cost. Core-shell nanoarchitecture strategies are versatile and powerful tools for the design and synthesis of advanced high-k polymer nanocomposites. Recent and in-progress state-of-the-art advancements in the application of core-shell nanoarchitecture strategies to design and prepare high-k polymer nanocomposites are summarized. Special focus is directed to emphasizing their advantages over conventional melt-mixing and solution-mixing methods: first, homogeneous nanoparticle dispersion can be easily achieved even in highly loaded nanocomposites; second, the dielectric constant of the nanocomposites can be effectively enhanced and meanwhile the high breakdown strength can be well-preserved; third, for nanocomposites filled with electrically conductive nanoparticles, dielectric loss can be effectively surpressed, and meanwhile a high dielectric constant can be achieved. In addition, fundamental insights into the roles of the interfaces on the dielectric properties of the nanocomposites can be probed. The last part of the article is concluded with current problems and future perspectives of utilizing the core-shell nanoarchitecture strategies for the development of high-k polymer nanocomposites."
FeElectric,WOS:000374274700004,13-Apr,2016,"Recent Progress on Ferroelectric Polymer-Based Nanocomposites for High Energy Density Capacitors: Synthesis, Dielectric Properties, and Future Aspects","Dielectric polymer nanocomposites are rapidly emerging as novel materials for a number of advanced engineering applications. In this Review, we present a comprehensive review of the use of ferroelectric polymers, especially PVDF and PVDF-based copolymers/blends as potential components in dielectric nanocomposite materials for high energy density capacitor applications. Various parameters like dielectric constant, dielectric loss, breakdown strength, energy density, and flexibility of the polymer nanocomposites have been thoroughly investigated. Fillers with different shapes have been found to cause significant variation in the physical and electrical properties. Generally, one-dimensional and two-dimensional nanofillers with large aspect ratios provide enhanced flexibility versus zero-dimensional fillers. Surface modification of nanomaterials as well as polymers adds flavor to the dielectric properties of the resulting nanocomposites. Nowadays, three-phase nanocomposites with either combination of fillers or polymer matrix help in further improving the dielectric properties as compared to two-phase nanocomposites. Recent research has been focused on altering the dielectric properties of different materials while also maintaining their superior flexibility. Flexible polymer nanocomposites are the best candidates for application in various fields. However, certain challenges still present, which can be solved only by extensive research in this field."
FeElectric,WOS:000355533000012,15-May,2015,The dynamics of methylammonium ions in hybrid organic-inorganic perovskite solar cells,"Methylammonium lead iodide perovskite can make high-efficiency solar cells, which also show an unexplained photocurrent hysteresis dependent on the device-poling history. Here we report quasielastic neutron scattering measurements showing that dipolar CH3NH3+ ions reorientate between the faces, corners or edges of the pseudo-cubic lattice cages in CH3NH3PbI3 crystals with a room temperature residence time of similar to 14 ps. Free rotation, p-flips and ionic diffusion are ruled out within a 1-200-ps time window. Monte Carlo simulations of interacting CH3NH3+ dipoles realigning within a 3D lattice suggest that the scattering measurements may be explained by the stabilization of CH3NH3+ in either antiferroelectric or ferroelectric domains. Collective realignment of CH3NH3+ to screen a device's built-in potential could reduce photovoltaic performance. However, we estimate the timescale for a domain wall to traverse a typical device to be similar to 0.1-1 ms, faster than most observed hysteresis."
FeElectric,WOS:000370453900015,16-Feb,2016,Lewis Acid-Base Adduct Approach for High Efficiency Perovskite Solar Cells,"CONSPECTUS: Since the first report on the long-term durable 9.7% solid-state perovskite solar cell employing methylammonium lead iodide (CH3NH3PbI3), mesoporous TiO2, and 2,2',7,7'-tetralds[N,N-di(4-methoxyphenyl)amino]-9,9'-spirobifluorene (spiro-MeOTAD) in 2012, following the seed technologies on perovskitesensitized liquid junction solar cells in 2009 and 2011, a surge of interest has been focused on perovskite solar cells due to superb photovoltaic performance and extremely facile fabrication processes. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells reached 21% in a very short period of time. Such an unprecedentedly high photovoltaic performance is due to the intrinsic optoelectronic property of organolead iodide perovskite material. Moreover, a high dielectric constant, sub-millimeter scale carrier diffusion length, an underlying ferroelectric property, and ion migration behavior can make organolead halide perovskites suitable for multifunctionality. Thus, besides solar cell applications, perovskite material has recently been applied to a variety fields of materials science such as photodetectors, light emitting diodes, lasing, X-ray imaging, resistive memory, and water splitting. Regardless of application areas, the growth of a well-defined perovskite layer with high crystallinity is essential for effective utilization of its excellent physicochemical properties. Therefore, an effective methodology for preparation of high quality perovskite layers is required.In this Account, an effective methodology for production of high quality perovskite layers is described, which is the Lewis acid base adduct approach. In the solution process to form the perovskite layer, the key chemicals of CH3NH3I (or HC(NH2)(2)I) and PbI2 are used by dissolving them in polar aprotic solvents. Since polar aprotic solvents bear oxygen, sulfur, or nitrogen, they can act as a Lewis base. In addition, the main group compound PIA, is known to be a Lewis acid. Thus, PbI2 has a chance to form an adduct by reacting with the Lewis base. Crystal growth and morphology of perovskite can be controlled by taking advantage of the weak chemical interaction in the adduct. We have successfully fabricated highly reproducible CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cells with PCE as high as 19.7% via adducts of PbI2 with oxygen-donor N,N'-dimethyl sulfoxide. This adduct approach has been found to be generally adopted, where formamidinium lead iodide perovskite, HC(NH2)(2)PbI3 (FAPbI(3)), with large grain, high crystallinity, and long-lived carrier lifetime was successfully fabricated via an adduct of PbI2 with sulfur-donor thiourea as Lewis base. The adduct approach proposed in this Account is a very promising methodology to achieve high quality perovskite films with high photovoltaic performance. Furthermore, single crystal growth on the conductive substrate is expected to be possible if we kinetically control the elimination of Lewis base in the adduct."
FeElectric,WOS:000371130800001,16-Feb,2016,Ionic polarization-induced current-voltage hysteresis in CH3NH3PbX3 perovskite solar cells,"CH3NH3PbX3 (MAPbX(3)) perovskites have attracted considerable attention as absorber materials for solar light harvesting, reaching solar to power conversion efficiencies above 20%. In spite of the rapid evolution of the efficiencies, the understanding of basic properties of these semiconductors is still ongoing. One phenomenon with so far unclear origin is the so-called hysteresis in the current-voltage characteristics of these solar cells. Here we investigate the origin of this phenomenon with a combined experimental and computational approach. Experimentally the activation energy for the hysteretic process is determined and compared with the computational results. First-principles simulations show that the timescale for MA(+) rotation excludes a MA-related ferroelectric effect as possible origin for the observed hysteresis. On the other hand, the computationally determined activation energies for halide ion (vacancy) migration are in excellent agreement with the experimentally determined values, suggesting that the migration of this species causes the observed hysteretic behaviour of these solar cells."
FeElectric,WOS:000346828000016,15-Jan,2015,Bandgap tuning of multiferroic oxide solar cells,"Multiferroic films are increasingly being studied for applications in solar energy conversion because of their efficient ferroelectric polarization-driven carrier separation and above-bandgap generated photovoltages, which in principle can lead to energy conversion efficiencies beyond the maximum value (similar to 34%) reported in traditional silicon-based bipolar heterojunction solar cells. However, the efficiency reported so far is still too low (<2%) to be considered for commercialization. Here, we demonstrate a new approach to effectively tune the bandgap of double perovskite multiferroic oxides by engineering the cationic ordering for the case of Bi2FeCrO6. Using this approach, we report a power conversion efficiency of 8.1% under AM 1.5 G irradiation (100 mWcm(-2)) for Bi2FeCrO6 thin-film solar cells in a multilayer configuration."
FeElectric,WOS:000364700200002,11-Nov,2015,Ultrasensitive and Broadband MoS2 Photodetector Driven by Ferroelectrics,"A few-layer MoS2 photodetector driven by poly(vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene) ferroelectrics is achieved. The detectivity and responsitivity are up to 2.2 x 10(12) Jones and 2570 A W-1, respectively, at 635 nm with ZERO gate bias. E-g of MoS2 is tuned by the ultra-high electrostatic field from the ferroelectric polarization. The photo response wavelengths of the photo detector are extended into the near-infrared (0.85-1.55 mu m)."
FeElectric,WOS:000371563700027,3-Mar,2016,Origin of J-V Hysteresis in Perovskite Solar Cells,"High-performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs) based on organometal halide perovskite have emerged in the past five years as excellent devices for harvesting solar energy. Some remaining challenges should be resolved to continue the momentum in their development. The photocurrent density-voltage (J-V) responses of the PSCs demonstrate anomalous dependence on the voltage scan direction/rate/range, voltage conditioning history, and device configuration. The hysteretic J-V behavior presents a challenge for determining the accurate power conversion efficiency of the PSCs. Here, we review the recent progress on the investigation of the origin(s) of J-V hysteresis behavior in PSCs. We discuss the impact of slow transient capacitive current, trapping and detrapping process, ion migrations, and ferroelectric polarization on the hysteresis behavior. The remaining issues and future research required toward the understanding of J-V hysteresis in PSCs will also be discussed."
FeElectric,WOS:000216598200044,15-Oct,2015,Fingertip skin-inspired microstructured ferroelectric skins discriminate static/dynamic pressure and temperature stimuli,"In human fingertips, the fingerprint patterns and interlocked epidermal-dermal microridges play a critical role in amplifying and transferring tactile signals to various mechanoreceptors, enabling spatiotemporal perception of various static and dynamic tactile signals. Inspired by the structure and functions of the human fingertip, we fabricated fingerprint-like patterns and interlocked microstructures in ferroelectric films, which can enhance the piezoelectric, pyroelectric, and piezoresistive sensing of static and dynamic mechanothermal signals. Our flexible and microstructured ferroelectric skins can detect and discriminate between multiple spatiotemporal tactile stimuli including static and dynamic pressure, vibration, and temperature with high sensitivities. As proof-of-concept demonstration, the sensors have been used for the simultaneous monitoring of pulse pressure and temperature of artery vessels, precise detection of acoustic sounds, and discrimination of various surface textures. Our microstructured ferroelectric skins may find applications in robotic skins, wearable sensors, and medical diagnostic devices."
FeElectric,WOS:000365460700030,19-Nov,2015,Control of I-V Hysteresis in CH3NH3PbI3 Perovskite Solar Cell,"Mismatch of current (I)-voltage (V) curves with respect to the scan direction, so-called I-V hysteresis, raises critical issue in MAPbI(3) (MA = CH3NH3) perovskite solar cell. Although ferroelectric and ion migration have been proposed as a basis for the hysteresis, origin of hysteresis has not been apparently unraveled. We report here on the origin of I-V hysteresis of perovskite solar cell that was systematically evaluated by the interface-dependent electrode polarizations. Frequency (f)-dependent capacitance (C) revealed that the normal planar structure with the TiO2/MAPbI(3)/spiro-MeOTAD configuration showed most significant I-V hysteresis along with highest capacitance (10(-2) F/cm(2)) among the studied cell configurations. Substantial reduction in capacitance to 10(-3) F/cm(2) was observed upon replacing TiO2 with PCBM, indicative of the TiO2 layer being mainly responsible for the hysteresis. The capacitance was intensively reduced to 10(-5) F/cm(2) and C-f feature shifted to higher frequency for the hysteresis-free planar structures with combination of PEDOT:PSS, NiO, and PCBM, which underlines the spiro-MeOTAD in part contributes to the hysteresis. This work is expected to provide a key to the solution of the problem on I-V hysteresis in perovskite solar cell."
FeElectric,WOS:000365898400025,15-Dec,2015,Orbitally driven giant phonon anharmonicity in SnSe,"Understanding elementary excitations and their couplings in condensed matter systems is critical for developing better energy-conversion devices. In thermoelectric materials, the heat-to-electricity conversion efficiency is directly improved by suppressing the propagation of phonon quasiparticles responsible for macroscopic thermal transport. The current record material for thermoelectric conversion efficiency, SnSe, has an ultralow thermal conductivity, but the mechanism behind the strong phonon scattering remains largely unknown. From inelastic neutron scattering measurements and first-principles simulations, we mapped the four-dimensional phonon dispersion surfaces of SnSe, and found the origin of the ionic-potential anharmonicity responsible for the unique properties of SnSe. We show that the giant phonon scattering arises from an unstable electronic structure, with orbital interactions leading to a ferroelectric-like lattice instability. The present results provide a microscopic picture connecting electronic structure and phonon anharmonicity in SnSe, and offers new insights on how electron-phonon and phonon-phonon interactions may lead to the realization of ultralow thermal conductivity."
FeElectric,WOS:000355540900001,15-May,2015,A lead-halide perovskite molecular ferroelectric semiconductor,"Inorganic semiconductor ferroelectrics such as BiFeO3 have shown great potential in photovoltaic and other applications. Currently, semiconducting properties and the corresponding application in optoelectronic devices of hybrid organo-plumbate or stannate are a hot topic of academic research; more and more of such hybrids have been synthesized. Structurally, these hybrids are suitable for exploration of ferroelectricity. Therefore, the design of molecular ferroelectric semiconductors based on these hybrids provides a possibility to obtain new or high-performance semiconductor ferroelectrics. Here we investigated Pb-layered perovskites, and found the layer perovskite (benzylammonium)(2)PbCl4 is ferroelectric with semiconducting behaviours. It has a larger ferroelectric spontaneous polarization P-s = 13 mu C cm(-2) and a higher Curie temperature T-c = 438 K with a band gap of 3.65 eV. This finding throws light on the new properties of the hybrid organo-plumbate or stannate compounds and provides a new way to develop new semiconductor ferroelectrics."
FeElectric,WOS:000386103700024,12-Oct,2016,Superior Piezoelectric Properties in Potassium-Sodium Niobate Lead-Free Ceramics,"A superior piezoelectric coefficient (d(33) = 570 +/- 10 pC N-1), the highest value reported to date in potassium-sodium niobate-based ceramics, is obtained in (1-x-y)K1-wNawNb1-zSbzO3-yBaZrO3-x-Bi0.5K 0.5HfO3 ceramics. This high d(33) value can be ascribed to the co-existence of ""nano-scale strain domains"" (1-2 nm) and a high density of ferroelectric domain boundaries. Therefore, ternary KNN-based ceramics demonstrate the potential for applications."
FeElectric,WOS:000348600200015,15-Feb,2015,Negative capacitance in a ferroelectric capacitor,"The Boltzmann distribution of electrons poses a fundamental barrier to lowering energy dissipation in conventional electronics, often termed as Boltzmann Tyranny(1-5). Negative capacitance in ferroelectric materials, which stems from the stored energy of a phase transition, could provide a solution, but a direct measurement of negative capacitance has so far been elusive(1-3). Here, we report the observation of negative capacitance in a thin, epitaxial ferroelectric film. When a voltage pulse is applied, the voltage across the ferroelectric capacitor is found to be decreasing with time-in exactly the opposite direction to which voltage for a regular capacitor should change. Analysis of this 'inductance'-like behaviour from a capacitor presents an unprecedented insight into the intrinsic energy profile of the ferroelectric material and could pave the way for completely new applications."
FeElectric,WOS:000347513700024,1-Jan,2015,Emergence of Hysteresis and Transient Ferroelectric Response in Organo-Lead Halide Perovskite Solar Cells,"Although there has been rapid progress in the efficiency of perovskite-based solar cells, hysteresis in the current-voltage performance is not yet completely understood. Owing to its complex structure, it is not easy to attribute the hysteretic behavior to any one of different components, such as the bulk of the perovskite or different heterojunction interfaces. Among organo-lead halide perovskites, methylammonium lead iodide perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3) is known to have a ferroelectric property. The present investigation reveals a strong correlation between transient ferroelectric polarization of CH3NH3PbI3 induced by an external bias in the dark and hysteresis enhancement in photovoltaic characteristics. Our results demonstrate that the reverse bias poling (-0.3 to -1.1 V) of CH3NH3PbI3 photovoltaic layers prior to the photocurrent-voltage measurement generates stronger hysteresis whose extent changes significantly by the cell architecture. The phenomenon is interpreted as the effect of remanent polarization in the perovskite film on the photocurrent, which is most enhanced in planar perovskite structures without mesoporous scaffolds."
FeElectric,WOS:000386257300004,16-Aug,2016,The evolution of multiferroics,"Materials with a coexistence of magnetic and ferroelectric order - multiferroics - provide an efficient route for the control of magnetism by electric fields. The study of multiferroics dates back to the 1950s, but in recent years, key discoveries in theory, synthesis and characterization techniques have led to a new surge of interest in these materials. Different mechanisms, such as lone-pair, geometric, charge-ordering and spin-driven effects, can support multiferroicity. The general focus of the field is now shifting into neighbouring research areas, as we discuss in this Review. Multiferroic thin-film heterostructures, device architectures, and domain and interface effects are explored. The violation of spatial and inversion symmetry in multiferroic materials is a key feature because it determines their properties. Other aspects, such as the non-equilibrium dynamics of multiferroics, are underrated and should be included in the topics that will define the future of the field."
FeElectric,WOS:000351216500001,18-Mar,2015,Ferroelectricity and Antiferroelectricity of Doped Thin HfO2-Based Films,"The recent progress in ferroelectricity and antiferroelectricity in HfO2-based thin films is reported. Most ferroelectric thin film research focuses on perovskite structure materials, such as Pb(Zr,Ti)O-3, BaTiO3, and SrBi2Ta2O9, which are considered to be feasible candidate materials for non-volatile semiconductor memory devices. However, these conventional ferroelectrics suffer from various problems including poor Si-compatibility, environmental issues related to Pb, large physical thickness, low resistance to hydrogen, and small bandgap. In 2011, ferroelectricity in Si-doped HfO2 thin films was first reported. Various dopants, such as Si, Zr, Al, Y, Gd, Sr, and La can induce ferroelectricity or antiferroelectricity in thin HfO2 fi lms. They have large remanent polarization of up to 45 mu C cm(-2), and their coercive field (approximate to 1-2 MV c(-1)) is larger than conventional ferroelectric fi lms by approximately one order of magnitude. Furthermore, they can be extremely thin (<10 nm) and have a large bandgap (>5 eV). These differences are believed to overcome the barriers of conventional ferroelectrics in memory applications, including ferroelectric field-effect-transistors and three-dimensional capacitors. Moreover, the coupling of electric and thermal properties of the antiferroelectric thin fi lms is expected to be useful for various applications, including energy harvesting/storage, solid-state-cooling, and infrared sensors."
FeElectric,WOS:000366339600003,15-Dec,2015,Rashba Spin-Orbit Coupling Enhanced Carrier Lifetime in CH(3)NH(3)Pbl(3),"Organometal halide perovskites are promising solar-cell materials for next-generation photovoltaic applications. The long carrier lifetime and diffusion length of these materials make them very attractive for use in light absorbers and carrier transporters. While these aspects of organometal halide perovskites have attracted the most attention, the consequences of the Rashba effect, driven by strong spin orbit coupling, on the photovoltaic properties of these materials are largely unexplored. In this work, taking the electronic structure of CH3NH3PbI3 (methylammonium lead iodide) as an example, we propose an intrinsic mechanism for enhanced carrier lifetime in three-dimensional (3D) Rashba materials. On the basis of first-principles calculations and a Rashba spin orbit model, we demonstrate that the recombination rate is reduced due to the spin-forbidden transition. These results are important for understanding the fundamental physics of organometal halide perovskites and for optimizing and designing the materials with better performance. The proposed mechanism including spin degrees of freedom offers a new paradigm of using 3D Rashba materials for photovoltaic applications."
FeElectric,WOS:000369916700034,11-Feb,2016,Observation of polar vortices in oxide superlattices,"The complex interplay of spin, charge, orbital and lattice degrees of freedom provides a plethora of exotic phases and physical phenomena(1-5). In recent years, complex spin topologies have emerged as a consequence of the electronic band structure and the interplay between spin and spin-orbit coupling in materials-(6,7). Here we produce complex topologies of electrical polarization-namely, nanometre-scale vortex-antivortex (that is, clockwise-anticlockwise) arrays that are reminiscent of rotational spin topologies(6)-by making use of the competition between charge, orbital and lattice degrees of freedom in superlattices of alternating lead titanate and strontium titanate layers. Atomic-scale mapping of the polar atomic displacements by scanning transmission electron microscopy reveals the presence of long-range ordered vortex-antivortex arrays that exhibit nearly continuous polarization rotation. Phase-field modelling confirms that the vortex array is the low-energy state for a range of superlattice periods. Within this range, the large gradient energy from the vortex structure is counterbalanced by the corresponding large reduction in overall electrostatic energy (which would otherwise arise from polar discontinuities at the lead titanate/strontium titanate interfaces) and the elastic energy associated with epitaxial constraints and domain formation. These observations have implications for the creation of new states of matter (such as dipolar skyrmions, hedgehog states) and associated phenomena in ferroic materials, such as electrically controllable chirality."
FeElectric,WOS:000349942500019,19-Feb,2015,Ferroelectric Domain Wall Induced Band Gap Reduction and Charge Separation in Organometal Halide Perovskites,"Organometal halide perovskites have been intensely studied in the past S years, inspired by their certified high photovoltaic power conversion efficiency. Some of these materials are room-temperature ferroelectrics. The presence of switchable ferroelectric domains in methylammonium lead triiodide, CH3NH3PbI3, has recently been observed via piezoresponse force microscopy. Here, we focus on the structural and electronic properties of ferroelectric domain walls in CH3NH3PbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I). We find that organometal halide perovskites can form both charged and uncharged domain walls due to the flexible orientational order of the organic molecules. The electronic band gaps for domain structures possessing 180 and 90 walls are estimated with density functional theory. It is found that the presence of charged domain walls will significantly reduce the band gap by 20-40%, while the presence of uncharged domain walls has no substantial impact on the band gap. We demonstrate that charged domain walls can serve as segregated channels for the motions of charge carriers. These results highlight the importance of ferroelectric domain walls in hybrid perovskites for photovoltaic applications and suggest a possible avenue for device optimization through domain patterning."
FeElectric,WOS:000405901600042,21-Jul,2017,"An organic-inorganic perovskite ferroelectric with large piezoelectric response (vol 357, pg 306, 2017)","Molecular piezoelectrics are highly desirable for their easy and environment-friendly processing, light weight, low processing temperature, and mechanical flexibility. However, although 136 years have passed since the discovery in 1880 of the piezoelectric effect, molecular piezoelectrics with a piezoelectric coefficient d(33) comparable with piezoceramics such as barium titanate (BTO; similar to 190 picocoulombs per newton) have not been found. We show that trimethylchloromethyl ammonium trichloromanganese(II), an organic-inorganic perovskite ferroelectric crystal processed from aqueous solution, has a large d(33) of 185 picocoulombs per newton and a high phase-transition temperature of 406 kelvin (K) (16 K above that of BTO). This makes it a competitive candidate for medical, micromechanical, and biomechanical applications."
FeElectric,WOS:000348662400033,15-Feb,2015,Relaxor Ferroelectric BaTiO3-Bi(Mg2/3Nb1/3)O-3 Ceramics for Energy Storage Application,"Perovskite solid solution ceramics of (1-x)BaTiO3-xBi(Mg2/3Nb1/3)O-3 (BT-BMN) (x=0.05-0.2) were synthesized by solid-state reaction technique. The results show that the BMN addition could lower the sintering temperature of BT-based ceramics. X-ray diffraction results reveal a pure perovskite structure for all studied samples. Dielectric measurements exhibit a relaxor-like characteristic for the BT-BMN ceramics, where broadened phase transition peaks change to a temperature-stable permittivity plateau (from -50 degrees C to 300 degrees C) with increasing the BMN content (x=0.2), and slim polarization-electric field hysteresis loops were observed in samples with x0.1. The dielectric breakdown strength and electrical resistivity of BT-BMN ceramics show their maxima of 287.7kV/cm and 1.53x10(13)cm at x=0.15, and an energy density of about 1.13J/cm(3) is achieved in the sample of x=0.1."
FeElectric,WOS:000378280400007,16-Jul,2016,Dynamic molecular crystals with switchable physical properties,"The development of molecular materials whose physical properties can be controlled by external stimuli - such as light, electric field, temperature, and pressure - has recently attracted much attention owing to their potential applications in molecular devices. There are a number of ways to alter the physical properties of crystalline materials. These include the modulation of the spin and redox states of the crystal's components, or the incorporation within the crystalline lattice of tunable molecules that exhibit stimuli-induced changes in their molecular structure. A switching behaviour can also be induced by changing the molecular orientation of the crystal's components, even in cases where the overall molecular structure is not affected. Controlling intermolecular interactions within a molecular material is also an effective tool to modulate its physical properties. This Review discusses recent advances in the development of such stimuli-responsive, switchable crystalline compounds - referred to here as dynamic molecular crystals - and suggests how different approaches can serve to prepare functional materials."
FeElectric,WOS:000346214600001,15-Mar,2015,Advantages and challenges of relaxor-PbTiO3 ferroelectric crystals for electroacoustic transducers - A review,"Relaxor-PbTiO3 (PT) based ferroelectric crystals with the perovskite structure have been investigated over the last few decades due to their ultrahigh piezoelectric coefficients (d(33) > 1500 pC/N) and electromechanical coupling factors (k(33) > 90%), far outperforming state-of-the-art ferroelectric polycrystalline Pb(Zr,Ti)O-3 ceramics, and are at the forefront of advanced electroacoustic applications. In this review, the performance merits of relaxor-PT crystals in various electroacoustic devices are presented from a piezoelectric material viewpoint. Opportunities come from not only the ultrahigh properties, specifically coupling and piezoelectric coefficients, but through novel vibration modes and crystallographic/domain engineering. Figure of merits (FOMs) of crystals with various compositions and phases were established for various applications, including medical ultrasonic transducers, underwater transducers, acoustic sensors and tweezers. For each device application, recent developments in relaxor-PT ferroelectric crystals were surveyed and compared with state-of-the-art polycrystalline piezoelectrics, with an emphasis on their strong anisotropic features and crystallographic uniqueness, including engineered domain property relationships. This review starts with an introduction on electroacoustic transducers and the history of piezoelectric materials. The development of the high performance relaxor-PT single crystals, with a focus on their uniqueness in transducer applications, is then discussed. In the third part, various FOMs of piezoelectric materials for a wide range of ultrasound applications, including diagnostic ultrasound, therapeutic ultrasound, underwater acoustic and passive sensors, tactile sensors, acoustic tweezers and ultrasonic motors, are evaluated to provide a thorough understanding of the materials' behavior under operational conditions. Structure-property-performance relationships are then established. Finally, the impacts and challenges of relaxor-PT crystals are summarized to guide on-going and future research in the development of relaxor-PT crystals for the next generation electroacoustic transducers.

FeElectric,WOS:000401563200007,24-May,2017,Homogeneous/Inhomogeneous-Structured Dielectrics and their Energy-Storage Performances,"The demand for dielectric capacitors with higher energy-storage capability is increasing for power electronic devices due to the rapid development of electronic industry. Existing dielectrics for high-energy-storage capacitors and potential new capacitor technologies are reviewed toward realizing these goals. Various dielectric materials with desirable permittivity and dielectric breakdown strength potentially meeting the device requirements are discussed. However, some significant limitations for current dielectrics can be ascribed to their low permittivity, low breakdown strength, and high hysteresis loss, which will decrease their energy density and efficiency. Thus, the implementation of dielectric materials for high-energy-density applications requires the comprehensive understanding of both the materials design and processing. The optimization of high-energy-storage dielectrics will have far-reaching impacts on the sustainable energy and will be an important research topic in the near future."
FeElectric,WOS:000353606700041,22-Apr,2015,"Optoelectronic Studies of Methylammonium Lead Iodide Perovskite Solar Cells with Mesoporous TiO2: Separation of Electronic and Chemical Charge Storage, Understanding Two Recombination Lifetimes, and the Evolution of Band Offsets during J-V Hysteresis","Methylammonium lead iodide (MAPI) cells of the design FTO/sTiO(2)/mpTiO(2)/MAPI/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au, where FTO is fluorine-doped tin oxide, sTiO(2) indicates solid-TiO2, and mpTiO(2) is mesoporous TiO2, are studied using transient photovoltage (TPV), differential capacitance, charge extraction, current interrupt, and chronophotoamperometry. We show that in mpTiO(2)/MAPI cells there are two kinds of extractable charge stored under operation: a capacitive electronic charge (similar to 0.2 mu C/cm(2)) and another, larger charge (40 mu C/cm(2)), possibly related to mobile ions. Transient photovoltage decays are strongly double exponential with two time constants that differ by a factor of similar to 5, independent of bias light intensity. The fast decay (similar to 1 mu s at 1 sun) is assigned to the predominant charge recombination pathway in the cell. We examine and reject the possibility that the fast decay is due to ferroelectric relaxation or to the bulk photovoltaic effect. Like many MAPI solar cells, the studied cells show significant JV hysteresis. Capacitance vs open circuit voltage (V-oc) data indicate that the hysteresis involves a change in internal potential gradients, likely a shift in band offset at the TiO2/MAPI interface. The TPV results show that the Voc hysteresis is not due to a change in recombination rate constant. Calculation of recombination flux at V-oc suggests that the hysteresis is also not due to an increase in charge separation efficiency and that charge generation is not a function of applied bias. We also show that the JV hysteresis is not a light driven effect but is caused by exposure to electrical bias, light or dark."
FeElectric,WOS:000413992800004,17-Oct,2017,Lab-on-Skin: A Review of Flexible and Stretchable Electronics for Wearable Health Monitoring,"Skin is the largest organ of the human body, and it offers a diagnostic interface rich with vital biological signals from the inner organs, blood vessels, muscles, and dermis/epidermis. Soft, flexible, and stretchable electronic devices provide a novel platform to interface with soft tissues for robotic feedback and control, regenerative medicine, and continuous health monitoring. Here, we introduce the term ""lab-on-skin"" to describe a set of electronic devices that have physical properties, such as thickness, thermal mass, elastic modulus, and water-vapor permeability, which resemble those of the skin. These devices can conformally laminate on the epidermis to mitigate motion artifacts and mismatches in mechanical properties created by conventional, rigid electronics while simultaneously providing accurate, non-invasive, long-term, and continuous health monitoring. Recent progress in the design and fabrication of soft sensors with more advanced capabilities and enhanced reliability suggest an impending translation of these devices from the research lab to clinical environments. Regarding these advances, the first part of this manuscript reviews materials, design strategies, and powering systems used in soft electronics. Next, the paper provides an overview of applications of these devices in cardiology, dermatology, electrophysiology, and sweat diagnostics, with an emphasis on how these systems may replace conventional clinical tools. The review concludes with an outlook on current challenges and opportunities for future research directions in wearable health monitoring."
FeElectric,WOS:000351756200007,15-Apr,2015,Supramolecular ferroelectrics,"Supramolecular chemistry uses non-covalent interactions to coax molecules into forming ordered assemblies. The construction of ordered materials with these reversible bonds has led to dramatic innovations in organic electronics, polymer science and biomaterials. Here, we review how supramolecular strategies can advance the burgeoning field of organic ferroelectricity. Ferroelectrics -materials with a spontaneous and electrically reversible polarization -are touted for use in non-volatile computer memories, sensors and optics. Historically, this physical phenomenon has been studied in inorganic materials, although some organic examples are known and strong interest exists to extend the search for ferroelectric molecular systems. Other undiscovered applications outside this regime could also emerge. We describe the key features necessary for molecular and supramolecular dipoles in organic ferroelectrics and their incorporation into ordered systems, such as porous frameworks and liquid crystals. The goal of this Review is to motivate the development of innovative supramolecular ferroelectrics that exceed the performance and usefulness of known systems."
FeElectric,WOS:000354487100006,13-May,2015,A Hyper-Stretchable Elastic-Composite Energy Harvester,"A hyper-stretchable and deformable elastic-composite generator is developed using a piezoelectric nanocomposite composed of (1-x){Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O-3}-(x){PbTiO3} microparticles, carbon nanotubes, a silicone rubber matrix, and very long silver (Ag) nanowire percolation network electrodes. To date, this nanogenerator sets world records for output performance, strain capacity, mechanical stability, and commercial feasibility in the research field for stretchable and deformable piezoelectric energy harvesters."
FeElectric,WOS:000367841100002,6-Jan,2016,Multiferroic Heterostructures Integrating Ferroelectric and Magnetic Materials,"Multiferroic heterostructures can be synthesized by integrating monolithic ferroelectric and magnetic materials with interfacial coupling between electric polarization and magnetization, through the exchange of elastic, electric, and magnetic energy. Although the nature of the interfaces remains to be unraveled, such cross coupling can be utilized to manipulate the magnetization (or polarization) with an electric (or magnetic) field, known as a converse (or direct) magnetoelectric effect. It can be exploited to significantly improve the performance of or/and add new functionalities to many existing or emerging devices such as memory devices, tunable microwave devices, sensors, etc. The exciting technological potential, along with the rich physical phenomena at the interface, has sparked intensive research on multiferroic heterostructures for more than a decade. Here, we summarize the most recent progresses in the fundamental principles and potential applications of the interface-based magnetoelectric effect in multiferroic heterostructures, and present our perspectives on some key issues that require further study in order to realize their practical device applications."
FeElectric,WOS:000406764600001,16-Mar,2016,Lead-free piezoceramics - Where to move on?,"Lead-free piezoceramics aiming at replacing the market-dominant lead-based ones have been extensively searched for more than a decade worldwide. Some noteworthy outcomes such as the advent of commercial products for certain applications have been reported, but the goal, i.e., the invention of a lead-free piezocermic, the performance of which is equivalent or even superior to that of PZT-based piezoceramics, does not seem to be fulfilled yet. Nevertheless, the academic effort already seems to be culminated, waiting for a guideline to a future research direction. We believe that a driving force for a restoration of this research field needs to be found elsewhere, for example, intimate collaborations with related industries. For this to be effectively realized, it would be helpful for academic side to understand the interests and demands of the industry side as well as to provide the industry with new scientific insights that would eventually lead to new applications. Therefore, this review covers some of the issues that are to be studied further and deeper, so-to-speak, lessons from the history of piezoceramics, and some technical issues that could be useful in better understanding the industry demands. As well, the efforts made in the industry side will be briefly introduced for the academic people to catch up with the recent trends and to be guided for setting up their future research direction effectively.

FeElectric,WOS:000353606700014,22-Apr,2015,Highly Efficient Red-Light Emission in An Organic-Inorganic Hybrid Ferroelectric: (Pyrrolidinium)MnCl3,"Luminescence of ferroelectric materials is one important property for technological applications, such as low-energy electron excitation. However, the vast majority of doped inorganic ferroelectric materials have low luminescent efficiency. The past decade has envisaged much progress in the design of both ferroelectric and luminescent organic-inorganic hybrid complexes for optoelectronic applications. The combination of ferroelectricity and luminescence within organic-inorganic hybrids would lead to a new type of luminescent ferroelectric multifunctional materials. We herein report a hybrid molecular ferroelectric, (pyrrolidinium)MnCl3, which exhibits excellent ferroelectricity with a saturation polarization of 5.5 mu C/cm(2) as well as intense red luminescence with high quantum yield of 56% under a UV excitation. This finding may extend the application of organic-inorganic hybrid compounds to the field of ferroelectric luminescence and/or multifunctional devices."
FeElectric,WOS:000375889700051,16-May,2016,Intrinsic Ferroelasticity and/or Multiferroicity in Two-Dimensional Phosphorene and Phosphorene Analogues,"Phosphorene and phosphorene analogues such as SnS and SnSe monolayers are promising nanoelectronic materials with desired bandgap, high carrier mobility, and anisotropic structures. Here, we show first-principles calculation evidence that these monolayers are potentially the long-sought two-dimensional (2D) materials that can combine electronic transistor characteristic with nonvolatile memory readable/writeable capability at ambient condition. Specifically, phosphorene is predicted to be a 2D intrinsic ferroelastic material with ultrahigh reversible strain, whereas SnS, SnSe, GeS, and GeSe monolayers are multiferroic with coupled ferroelectricity and ferroelasticity. Moreover, their low-switching barriers render room-temperature nonvolatile memory accessible, and their notable structural anisotropy enables ferroelastic or ferroelectric switching readily readable via electrical, thermal, optical, mechanical, or even spintronic detection upon the swapping of the zigzag and armchair direction. In addition, it is predicted that the GeS and GeSe monolayers as well as bulk SnS and SnSe can maintain their ferroelasticity and ferroelectricity (anti-ferroelectricity) beyond the room temperature, suggesting high potential for practical device application."
FeElectric,WOS:000379580800045,15-Jul,2016,Discovery of robust in-plane ferroelectricity in atomic-thick SnTe,"Stable ferroelectricity with high transition temperature in nanostructures is needed for miniaturizing ferroelectric devices. Here, we report the discovery of the stable in-plane spontaneous polarization in atomic-thick tin telluride (SnTe), down to a 1-unit cell (UC) limit. The ferroelectric transition temperature T-c of 1-UC SnTe film is greatly enhanced from the bulk value of 98 kelvin and reaches as high as 270 kelvin. Moreover, 2- to 4-UC SnTe films show robust ferroelectricity at room temperature. The interplay between semiconducting properties and ferroelectricity in this two-dimensional material may enable a wide range of applications in nonvolatile high-density memories, nanosensors, and electronics."
FeElectric,WOS:000443125300002,15-Dec,2015,Benchmarking of Beyond-CMOS Exploratory Devices for Logic Integrated Circuits,"A new benchmarking of beyond-CMOS exploratory devices for logic integrated circuits is presented. It includes new devices with ferroelectric, straintronic, and orbitronic computational state variables. Standby power treatment and memory circuits are included. The set of circuits is extended to sequential logic, including arithmetic logic units. The conclusion that tunneling field-effect transistors are the leading low-power option is reinforced. Ferroelectric transistors may present an attractive option with faster switching delay. Magnetoelectric effects are more energy efficient than spin transfer torque, but the switching speed of magnetization is a limitation. This article enables a better focus on promising beyond-CMOS exploratory devices."
FeElectric,WOS:000390509200009,16-Dec,2016,"Multiferroic bismuth ferrite-based materials for multifunctional applications: Ceramic bulks, thin films and nanostructures","Among the different types of multiferroic compounds, bismuth ferrite (BiFeO3; BFO) stands out because it is perhaps the only one being simultaneously magnetic and strongly ferroelectric at room temperature. Therefore, in the past decade or more, extensive research has been devoted to BFO-based materials in a variety of different forms, including ceramic bulks, thin films and nanostructures. Ceramic bulk BFO and their solid solutions with other oxide perovskite compounds show excellent ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties and are thus promising candidates for lead-free ferroelectric and piezoelectric devices. BFO thin films, on the other hand, exhibit versatile structures and many intriguing properties, particularly the robust ferroelectricity, the inherent magnetoelectric coupling, and the emerging photovoltaic effects. BFO-based nanostructures are of great interest owing to their size effect-induced structural modification and enhancement in various functional behaviors, such as magnetic and photocatalytic properties. Although to date several review papers on BFO and BFO-based materials have been published, they were each largely focused on one particular form of BFO. There have been very few papers addressing the different forms of BFO in a comprehensive manner and providing a comparison across the different forms. As BFO has been extensively studied over the past more than one decade especially in the past several years, there have been new phenomena arising more recently. Naturally they were not included in the early reviews. Here, we provide an updated comprehensive review on the progress of BFO-based materials made in the past fifteen years in the different forms of ceramic bulks, thin films and nanostructures, focusing on the pathways to modify different structures and to achieve enhanced physical properties and new functional behavior. We also prospect the future potential development for BFO-based materials in the cross disciplines and for multifunctional applications. We hope that this comprehensive review will serve as a timely updating and reference for researchers who are interested in further exploring bismuth ferrite-based materials. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

FeElectric,WOS:000382400900001,27-Jul,2016,Halide Perovskites: Poor Man's High-Performance Semiconductors,"Halide perovskites are a rapidly developing class of medium-bandgap semiconductors which, to date, have been popularized on account of their remarkable success in solid-state heterojunction solar cells raising the photovoltaic efficiency to 20% within the last 5 years. As the physical properties of the materials are being explored, it is becoming apparent that the photovoltaic performance of the halide perovskites is just but one aspect of the wealth of opportunities that these compounds offer as high-performance semiconductors. From unique optical and electrical properties stemming from their characteristic electronic structure to highly efficient real-life technological applications, halide perovskites constitute a brand new class of materials with exotic properties awaiting discovery. The nature of halide perovskites from the materials' viewpoint is discussed here, enlisting the most important classes of the compounds and describing their most exciting properties. The topics covered focus on the optical and electrical properties highlighting some of the milestone achievements reported to date but also addressing controversies in the vastly expanding halide perovskite literature."
