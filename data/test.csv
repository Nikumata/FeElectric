0,"J                                 A superior piezoelectric coefficient (d(33) = 570 +/- 10 pC N-1), the highest value reported to date in potassium-sodium niobate-based ceramics, is obtained in (1-x-y)K1-wNawNb1-zSbzO3-yBaZrO3-x-Bi0.5K 0.5HfO3 ceramics. This high d(33) value can be ascribed to the co-existence of ""nano-scale strain domains"" (1-2 nm) and a high density of ferroelectric domain boundaries. Therefore, ternary KNN-based ceramics demonstrate the potential for applications.                    WOS:000386103700024 27441456 
J                                 The development of molecular materials whose physical properties can be controlled by external stimuli - such as light, electric field, temperature, and pressure - has recently attracted much attention owing to their potential applications in molecular devices. There are a number of ways to alter the physical properties of crystalline materials. These include the modulation of the spin and redox states of the crystal's components, or the incorporation within the crystalline lattice of tunable molecules that exhibit stimuli-induced changes in their molecular structure. A switching behaviour can also be induced by changing the molecular orientation of the crystal's components, even in cases where the overall molecular structure is not affected. Controlling intermolecular interactions within a molecular material is also an effective tool to modulate its physical properties. This Review discusses recent advances in the development of such stimuli-responsive, switchable crystalline compounds - referred to here as dynamic molecular crystals - and suggests how different approaches can serve to prepare functional materials.

J                                 Dielectric polymer nanocomposites are rapidly emerging as novel materials for a number of advanced engineering applications. In this Review, we present a comprehensive review of the use of ferroelectric polymers, especially PVDF and PVDF-based copolymers/blends as potential components in dielectric nanocomposite materials for high energy density capacitor applications. Various parameters like dielectric constant, dielectric loss, breakdown strength, energy density, and flexibility of the polymer nanocomposites have been thoroughly investigated. Fillers with different shapes have been found to cause significant variation in the physical and electrical properties. Generally, one-dimensional and two-dimensional nanofillers with large aspect ratios provide enhanced flexibility versus zero-dimensional fillers. Surface modification of nanomaterials as well as polymers adds flavor to the dielectric properties of the resulting nanocomposites. Nowadays, three-phase nanocomposites with either combination of fillers or polymer matrix help in further improving the dielectric properties as compared to two-phase nanocomposites. Recent research has been focused on altering the dielectric properties of different materials while also maintaining their superior flexibility. Flexible polymer nanocomposites are the best candidates for application in various fields. However, certain challenges still present, which can be solved only by extensive research in this field.                    WOS:000374274700004 27040315 
J                                 Semiconducting ferroelectricity is realized in hybrid perovskite-type compounds (cyclohexylammonium)(2) PbBr4-4x I-4x (x = 0-1). By adjusting the composition x, the bandgap is successfully tuned from previously reported 3.65 eV to as low as 2.74 eV, and the excellent ferroelectricity was kept intact. This finding may contribute to improving the photoelectronic and/or photo voltaic performance of hybrid perovskite-type compounds.                    WOS:000373292700012 26833877
